// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

//Sum Two Variables
sum = variable1 + variable2

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

//Check if the number is odd or even
if number % 2 == 0:
    print(number, "is even.")
else:
    print(number, "is odd.")

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

//Prompt the user for input
numbers = []
for i in range(5):
    number = float(input("Enter number {}: ".format(i+1)))
    numbers.append(number)

//Calculate the average
average = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

//Find the smallest and largest numbers
smallest = min(numbers)
largest = max(numbers)

//Print the results
print("The average of the five numbers is:", average)
print("The smallest number is:", smallest)
print("The largest number is:", largest)
